# Python_Machine_Learning
Personal machine-learning projects using Python in order to review basic concepts of machine learning.

This notebook addresses classification problem - with **iris dataset** which is built in scikit-learn package.

Models : **K-nearest neighbors(KNN)** and **Logistic Regression**.

Evaluations metrics : **train/test split** and **K-fold cross validation**.

Plus, in order to search optimal tuning parameters, I used **GridSearchCV**.
