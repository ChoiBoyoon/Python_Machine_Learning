# Scikit-Learn basics with Python (Machine Learning)
> Personal machine-learning projects using Python in order to review basic concepts of machine learning.

### 1. ML basics_study with iris dataset (classification)_.ipynb
* This notebook addresses classification problem - with **iris dataset** which is built in scikit-learn package.
* Models : **K-nearest neighbors(KNN)** and **Logistic Regression**.
* Evaluations metrics : **train/test split** and **K-fold cross validation**.
* Plus, in order to search optimal tuning parameters, **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** is used.

### 2. Pima_Indians_Diabetes(Classification_Evaluation_Metrics).ipynb
* Question: **Can we predict the diabetes status** of a patient givne their health measurements?
* Data source : Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
* This notebook aims to examine various **classification evaluation metrics** and **ROC Curves and AUC**
    * ex. confusion matrix, senstivity, precision, etc.

### 3. Pima_Indians_Diabetes(Classification).ipynb
* Question: **Can we predict the diabetes status** of a patient givne their health measurements?
* Data source : Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
* In this notebook, we'll follow text-book approach to classification problem.
   * 1. exploratory data analysis.
   * 2. locate and remove outliers.
